- Don't try to update Smart Connect and Lifelog through Google Play if it ask you because they will not work correctly like some functions not available. Just uncheck the checkbox to update automatically and all should be fine.

-Don't try to change the location of the apps like putting them as system app or something else (All the apps are installed as data app)
