***S+ Reborn Users**

From Lolipop i decided to include again as default the Tweaks and this happened just because LP is 
More heavy than KK so the ROM is more stable with the ones included
But in the main time i decided to leave the choice to the user to install some tweaks-addon.
These tweaks addons are featured with the Nitrox ones provided by.....  
In the next page you will need to choose if you want to install these tweaks-addon or to uninstall them if 
you installed them earlier.
If you don't want to install any kind of these tweaks choose the default option.
