***S+ Reborn Users**

The Reborn Tweaks usually used to be included in the ROM by default. 
But from Release 12 i decided to make the ROM more simplistic with less 
Blotware or something else and to leave the option to the user to decide this.
In the next page you will two kind of Reborn Tweaks: Battery Saver and Performance, choose the one you desire...
If you don't want to install any kind of these tweaks choose the default option.
